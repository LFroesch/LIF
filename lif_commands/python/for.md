# Python For Loops

# A list of animals
animals = ["bear", "tiger", "elephant", "wolf"]

# For loop to iterate over each item in the list
for animal in animals:
    print(f"The animal is: {animal}")

# For loop using a range to iterate with index incrementation
for i in range(len(animals)):
    print(f"Index {i}: {animals[i]}")
